# TF2 config files
Mostly adapted from https://github.com/tsumo/tf2configs/blob/master/README.md

closecaption_english files are not part of the config. They replace the files in `steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\resource` (make sure to delete any caption files in custom HUD)

I use m0rehud HUD with these changes: moved players alive/dead status bar to lower half of screen, replaced captions, increased size of target health cross and hp number
